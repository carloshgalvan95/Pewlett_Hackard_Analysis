# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
---
Pewlett Hackard is a large company both in several thousand employees and its been around for a long time, as baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, PH is looking toward the future in two ways:
- Offering retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria.
- Starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future

The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousand of job openings. we need to find answers to the following questions:
- Who will be retiring in the next few years?
- How many positions will PH need to fill?

This analysis will help future-proof PH by generating a list of all employees elegible for the retirement package and to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
---
To ensure PH is properly future proof we will need to look at the data of retirement-elegible positions, and "damage control" the large number of retirements upcoming by developing a mentorship program that will also help us prepare the young talents that the company has to take on the senior positions.

We divided the information to analyze into:
- Retiring Employees per title
- Employees who are elegible to participate in the mentorship program

The results per title for both were the following:

![mentorship](https://github.com/carloshgalvan95/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/resources/mentorship_titles.png)

1. We can observe that, as expected the title that will see more retirements will be 
- Senior Engineers 
- Senior Staff
This, on it's own doesn't represent a huge problem as, given the seniority status we can expect a big percentage to be elegible for the mentorship program, aiding in future proofing the company

2. There are 9285 Engineers and 7636 staff that are elegible for retiring, which is more problematic given that the title doesn't fit the retirement nor the criteria we would consider as a good mentor.

3. The two managers that we see on the table are also not that big of a problem given that this positions can be easily filled with experienced staff

4. We need to consider, given the numbers we see on the mentorship elegibility table, how many trainees every mentor can take at once to evaluate if those numbers are going to be enough to fuel our program.

## Summary
---
To draw conclusions and see where the main issues lay we have to analyze the proportion of retiring employees to mentorship elegible employees, in case the percentage is too low, it would may be best to wide our range of elegibility to seek that the number of retiring employees diminish.

We can see by this percentages that in terms of coverage, the bigger issues that we are going to have are with the roles of Assistant Engineer, Engineer and Staff.

One of the measures we can take is to move mentors from different titles to take trainees from other areas, for example senior engineers mentors taking technique leaders trainees.

The second approach, as previously mentioned woul be to broad the criteria for elegibility in the program.

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
The total amount of roles that will need to be filled are 72,458. Quite a concerning number that definitely needs to be addressed by the mentorship program.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Technically, yes, that would depend on the numbers of trainees each mentor can take unders it's wing, as previously stated there are multiple possible strategies to utilize if this is not the case.
