# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is a large company both in several thousand employees and its been around for a long time, as baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, PH is looking toward the future in two ways:
- Offering retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria.
- Starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future

The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousand of job openings. we need to find answers to the following questions:
- Who will be retiring in the next few years?
- How many positions will PH need to fill?

This analysis will help future-proof PH by generating a list of all employees elegible for the retirement package and to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

To ensure PH is properly future proof we will need to look at the data of retirement-elegible positions, and "damage control" the large number of retirements upcoming by developing a mentorship program that will also help us prepare the young talents that the company has to take on the senior positions.

We divided the information to analyze into:
- Retiring Employees per title
- Employees who are elegible to participate in the mentorship program

The results per title for both were the following:

## Summary

To draw conclusions and see where the main issues lay we have to analyze the proportion of retiring employees to mentorship elegible employees, in case the percentage is too low, it would may be best to wide our range of elegibility to seek that the number of retiring employees diminish.
